This repository contains any swift playground I coded in which my sole purpose was becoming more proficient with the language as opposed to working on a specific project. I have worked on becoming proficient with constants and variables, integers, floats, booleans, tuples, optionals, type safety, numeric type conversion, type aliases, basic operators, ternary conditional operators, and most recently, logical operators and combining logical operators.
